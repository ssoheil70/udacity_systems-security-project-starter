backdoor process name: remotesec

malicious process: /etc/darklord.sh copies /bin/nc to /tmp/remotesec
   From ossec logs the user updated the 'root' crontab and added '/etc/darklord.sh' script to crontab.
   The content of the '/etc/darklord.sh' creates a copy of '/bin/nc' to '/tmp/remotesec', creates a script and makes it executable and runs an instance of remotesec in background using a high range port (56565)

# Backdoor port number the above process is listening on
Backdoor port: 56565






#Terminal log from investigation is below:


ubuntu@ubuntu-VirtualBox:~$ sudo crontab -l
# Edit this file to introduce tasks to be run by cron.
# 
# Each task to run has to be defined through a single line
# indicating with different fields when the task will be run
# and what command to run for the task
# 
# To define the time you can provide concrete values for
# minute (m), hour (h), day of month (dom), month (mon),
# and day of week (dow) or use '*' in these fields (for 'any').# 
# Notice that tasks will be started based on the cron's system
# daemon's notion of time and timezones.
# 
# Output of the crontab jobs (including errors) is sent through
# email to the user the crontab file belongs to (unless redirected).
# 
# For example, you can run a backup of all your user accounts
# at 5 a.m every week with:
# 0 5 * * 1 tar -zcf /var/backups/home.tgz /home/
# 
# For more information see the manual pages of crontab(5) and cron(8)
