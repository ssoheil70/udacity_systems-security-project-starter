Apart from disabling remote login for 'root' user, it is recommended to encourage passwordless entry using RSA private/public key pairs. This can limit remote user access with password trys.
Other option is to limit number of retries for remote login. This can be achieved by setting MaxAuthTries value in /etc/ssh/sshd_config file.
Using a non-standard port for SSH is also another option to make the guessing harder and add another layer of protection.
Also a password rotaion mechanism would be a good practice.

In addition to all these steps for limiting access, carefully designing the sudoer capabilities of users to prevent arbitrary elevation of rights can further enhance the security level of the system.
Additionally outgoing ports for malicious or suspicious scripts should be blocked to prevent unwanted http requests
